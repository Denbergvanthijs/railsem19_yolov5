# Implementing YOLOv5 on the RailSem19 dataset

This repository implements multiple YOLOv5 models on the RailSem19 dataset. These implementations are focussed on the `person` and `person-group` classes.

## Installation

- The code is tested on [Python 3.9.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [PyTorch 1.10](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) with CUDA 11.3.
- Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) by following the instructions on their website.
- Install [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) by following the instructions in the README.
- Follow [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66800443) StackOverflow answer if you are experiencing the following error: `The paging file is too small for this operation to complete.`

Make sure YOLOv5 and railsem19_yolov5 are located in the same parent folder.

## Baseline results

The following results are achieved on the YOLOv5 models with only the `person` class:

![Results mAP](./baselines/baselines_mAP.png)
![Results time](./baselines/baselines_time.png)

---

The results for the baseline can be obtained by running the file `./results/generate_results.py`. Plots are generated by running `./results/analyse_baselines.py`.

The following column headers are used in the generated text files:
| Model, | Dataset | Precision | Recall | mAP@0.50 | mAP@0.50;0.05;0.95 | Pre-process time | Inference time | NMS time per image |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

## Training

The following command starts the training of your model:

```bash
python ../yolov5/train.py --batch-size -1 --epochs 100 --data ./data/rs19_person.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --single-cls
```

Use the following if you want do run the hyperparameter optimalisation process:

```bash
python ../yolov5/train.py --batch-size -1 --epochs 25 --data ./data/rs19_person.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --single-cls --evolve 50
```

## Inference

The following command runs inference on the provided data:

```bash
python ../yolov5/detect.py --source "path/to/file.mp4" --weights "./models/yolov5s.pt" --classes 0
```
